# consumerClustering
this project trys to find clusters with specific consume and group cosumers in order to their consums. 
after setting label for each consumer i uased a tree to find rules for each label and the result can show all information 
we have tree plot and bar plot which each cluster has been compared to all data based on consume and the Bill amount . 
these data pereproced ann model for 3 months in summer. 
for using K-Means algorithm i have used Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm  to find the best centroids for each cluster in K-Means.
